------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			
## Description
VBMFA is a variational approximation to a full Bayesian implementation
of Mixtures of Factor Analysers.

## Demos	
run
* demo_cake_ssl
* demo_gauss_ssl
* demo_spiral_ssl
* demo_ring_ssl
* demo_chainlink_ssl
* demo_atom_ssl
	
The code should work, but is by no means perfect and is both redundant and potentially 
buggy.
